## Hi there!
I am a kinda a guy who would understand you more if you were to code than talk.
I would always prefer coding over any any other means of communications. Dont get me wrong. I am an excellent
social being. Unless I feel you are annoying or
FAKE!. <br />
I am a techie from inside so other stuffs bore me!. Checkout my [BLOGS](../blog) in here to know what's my monkey mind is thinking at
the time'.
If you this below picture anywhere, that might be me! You can leave any kind of feedback at
arjunshetty2020@gmail.com.
