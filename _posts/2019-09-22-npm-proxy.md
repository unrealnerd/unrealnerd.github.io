Usually downloading packages has been pain over corporate networks. One way is to switch to personal network now and then to download packages.
Here is a work around for this, use any proxy server providing your credentials. But thing is everytime I change my password I break my head to finally realize the packages are not downloading because of the old credentials in the proxy settings. This is how I get around this, using [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler).

Once you have downloaded fiddler, open fiddler and then under rules menu check `Automatically Authenticate` <br/> ![screenshot](/../img/fiddler-authenticate.jpg).

### For NPM

Set using following commands

```shell
npm config set proxy http://localhost:8888/
npm config set https-proxy http://localhost:8888/
```
  
OR 


do this manually, open `C:\Users\<user name>\.npmrc` and set proxy to the port fiddler is running on like below

```conf
proxy=http://localhost:8888/
https-proxy=http://localhost:8888/
strict-ssl=false
```

`strict-ssl` is set to false to ignore certificate validation, Use this with caution there are a lot packages that are malicious.
now try `npm -i <packagename>`

### For MAVEN

Open `C:\Users\<user name>\.m2\settings.xml` and add this follwing section in `settings` node

```xml
<proxies>
    <proxy>
        <id>optional</id>
        <active>true</active>
        <protocol>http</protocol>
        <host>localhost</host>
        <port>8888</port>
        <nonProxyHosts></nonProxyHosts>
    </proxy>
    <proxy>
        <id>optional</id>
        <active>true</active>
        <protocol>https</protocol>
        <host>localhost</host>
        <port>8888</port>
        <nonProxyHosts></nonProxyHosts>
    </proxy>
</proxies>

```

### For GRADLE

Add this below properties in root folder of `gradle.properties`

```conf
systemProp.http.proxyHost=127.0.0.1
systemProp.http.proxyPort=8888
systemProp.https.proxyHost=127.0.0.1
systemProp.https.proxyPort=8888
```

Hope this Helps!
