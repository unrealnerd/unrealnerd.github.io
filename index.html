    <h1>Hi there, I'm Arjun!</h1>	
    <p>I am a kinda a guy who would understand you more if you were to code than talk.
        I would always prefer coding over any any other means of communications. Dont get me wrong. I am an excellent social being. Unless I feel you are annoying or 
        FAKE!. <br/>
        I am a techie from inside so other stuffs bore me!. Checkout my <a href="/blog">blogs</a> in here to know what I thiink the most about. 
        If you this below picture anywhere, that might be me! You can leave any kind of feedback at arjunshetty2020@gmail.com.
